Software localization made easy.

#### About

**Traduco** is a _Ruby on Rails_ web application that provides software developers with an easy-to-use localization platform to translate their applications.

This is the workflow that we enable:

#### For the developer

1. Create a project and specify its **Git** repository.
2. Select the translation files you're interested in.
3. Invite translators for each language you want you app translated in.
4. When the translators are done, push the new files back into the repository.

#### For the translator

1. Access **Traduco** from any browser.
2. View projects and languages that are assigned to you.
3. Translate some files through our unified web interface.
4. You're done!

#### Main benefits

* Easy-to-use web interface for the translators.
* **Git** compatibility.
* Works with lots of formats: iOS, Java, RESX (.Net).
